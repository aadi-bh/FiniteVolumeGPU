# ShallowWaterGPU

## Setup
A good place to start exploring this codebase is the notebooks. Complete the following steps to run the notebooks:

1. Install conda (see e.g. Miniconda or Anaconda)
2. Change directory to the repository root and run the following commands
3. conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
4. conda activate ShallowWaterGPU
5. jupyter notebook

Make sure you are running the correct kernel ("conda:ShallowWaterGPU"). If not, change kernel using the "Kernel"-menu in the notebook.

If you do not need to run notebooks you may use the conda environment found in conda_environment_hpc.yml
